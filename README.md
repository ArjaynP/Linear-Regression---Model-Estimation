# Linear-Regression---Model-Estimation

This assignment introduces you to the estimation of parameters through the minimization of a loss function. We are doing this in the context of linear regression. You will learn to plot the relationship between 2 variables, write a function that makes the model prediction, write a function that calculates the loss function, and how to estimate the parameters of the model. While there are many libraries that implement simple regression, you are learning here a universal way that is applicable to ANY mathematical model.
The data set possum.csv is a sample of 46 possums that were caught in Victoria (NZ) in a field study.
